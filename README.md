# Introduction
Lensr is an interactive optical simulator app made using JavaFX 19 for its graphical components.

In Lensr you can place different types of optical objects like mirrors, lenses, filters and light sources. The light rays will interact with the objects according to the laws of physics.

Feel free to check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/Adept-Unit-of-Tech-Innovators/Lensr/wiki) or [short video introduction](https://youtu.be/vNcO53g4Qb8?si=USa82o8ExrsD2_nd) to get you started.

# Installation
To run Lensr, download the lensr.jar executable from the latest release on our [Releases](https://github.com/Adept-Unit-of-Tech-Innovators/Lensr/releases) page and run the file by double clicking it.
You can also download the preset (.lensr) files and open them in the app to view some cool setups we've prepared (File -> Open (Ctrl+O))

Disclaimer:
If you don't have Java Runtime (version 19 or higher) installed (you might already have it if you for example play Minecraft), and thus are unable to run the .jar file, download it from the official website [here](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/19)
